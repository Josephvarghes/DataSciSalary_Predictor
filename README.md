# DataSciSalary Predictor

# Project Overview

The DataSciSalary Predictor project aims to predict the salary of data science employees based on several variables. This project provides insights into the factors influencing salaries and helps in forecasting salary ranges for future job roles in the field of data science.

# Problem Statement

How can we accurately predict the salary of data science employees using various factors derived from a dataset?

# Dataset Information

* Original Dataset: ds_salaries.csv

* Preprocessed Dataset: preprocessed_data-science.csv

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes that influence the salary of data science professionals. These variables were analyzed, cleaned, and visualized during the project to extract meaningful insights.

# Project Workflow

- Data Extraction

Loaded the dataset ds_salaries.csv into the environment.

- Data Cleaning

Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Cleaned data was saved to preprocessed_data-science.csv.

- Data Analysis and Visualization

Explored relationships between variables and their impact on salary.

Visualizations were created to highlight trends and patterns.

- Modeling (Optional Future Step)

The project can be extended to include machine learning models for salary prediction based on the preprocessed data.
